Shared Dependencies:

1. **Database Schema**: The database schema will be shared across all backend files (`database.py`, `data_processing.py`, `ai_engine.py`, `api_integration.py`, `authentication.py`) as they all interact with the database.

2. **User Authentication**: The user authentication mechanism will be shared across all frontend files (`web_application.py`, `mobile_compatibility.py`, `dashboard.py`, `video_integration.py`, `custom_reports.py`, `interactive_visualizations.py`) and some backend files (`authentication.py`) to ensure secure access.

3. **API Keys**: The API keys for third-party services like MySportsFeeds or Sportradar will be shared across `api_integration.py` and possibly some frontend files if they directly fetch data.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The frontend files will share DOM element IDs for JavaScript functions to manipulate. For example, the `dashboard.py`, `video_integration.py`, `custom_reports.py`, and `interactive_visualizations.py` might all reference a DOM element with the ID "chartContainer".

5. **Error Messages**: Standardized error messages will be shared across all files for consistent error handling and user feedback.

6. **Function Names**: Certain function names will be shared across files. For example, a function to fetch data might be called `fetchData()` and used in multiple files.

7. **Data Models**: The data models defined for players, games, and performances will be shared across backend files and possibly some frontend files for data display.

8. **Test Cases**: The test cases defined in `automated_testing.py` will be used across all files to ensure code quality and functionality.

9. **Deployment Scripts**: The deployment scripts defined in `vercel_deployment.py` and `domain_setup.py` will be used across all files during the deployment process.

10. **Security Protocols**: The security protocols defined in `data_privacy.py` and `authentication_and_authorization.py` will be used across all files to ensure data privacy and secure access.
